#Project Overview
In this project there are two options:

##Option 1 - Custom Application
1. Prepare a design document with an overview of project milestones and application overview for a project that meets the key areas defined in the rubric.
2. Develop your application to meet all specific requirements, submitting work along with your milestone schedule.
3. Submit your application along with a document outlining which features in your application satisfy rubric requirements.

The student will define their own project feature-set that meets criteria encompassing key areas of development skills covered within the nanodegree:

- Application Architecture
- UI and Layout
- API Connectivity and Data Persistence
- Hardware Integration
- User-based Functionality

##Project Steps
1. Construct a design document that outlines the projectâ€™s major and minor features, satisfying provided key development areas. This document should include milestone delivery targets and expectations.

2. Complete a minimal viable product that serves a proof of concept and meets milestone guidelines. Example: Application retrieves and displays data from API in basic UI. Key areas of application are present and navigable.

3. Refine core features into release-ready form and expand functionality to include support features to meet milestone guidelines. Example: Application utilizes API data and stores for offline use. Users can log in and retrieve data across device sessions and installations.

4. Finalize support features and polish user experience. Application to be delivered in a market-ready form. Example: Application UI/UX is well defined with appropriate animations and affordances. User-settings and customization are present and functional. The application utilizes API data when available and provides caching and storage options for use when appropriate.

##Option 2 - Political Preparedness
1. As an alternative to developing a custom project, you may elect to complete the previously described Political Preparedness application.
2. Download the Political Preparedness Project Starter Code
3. Follow the instructions to set up the project and build the app.
4. Check the Project Rubric to confirm that you have met all of the requirements.
5. Submit your project as either a zip file or a Github repository link.

In this project, students will build an application that provides civic data intended to provide educational opportunities to the U.S. electorate using data provided by the Google Civic Information API. Students will use data from this API to allow users to track information on target representatives and voting initiatives where applicable.

Users will be able to target a specific location and retrieve the associated civic data, displaying it to the user, and providing a clean user experience for consumption. Users will be able to save predefined locations for quick access and mark preferred representatives and policy outcomes. Where available, elections and voter information will also be provided, notifying the users on upcoming elections and providing access to associated information and saved data.

###Target Milestones
1. Create the design document and construct the basic application UI.
2. Integrate the API so that the application can pull civic data for a provided address and store locally. Allow users to mark preferred candidates.
   - Register the API in the Google Developer Console and ensure the application can connect.
3. Expand API functionality to include ballot data for provided locations and corresponding user selections.
4. Enable user-level authentication and data storage. Expand location selection to use geo-location to generate address information. Refine and enhance UI.
